        &nbsp;I have five stories in this wonderful collection. To the blurb:

        <p>How do authors' voices change when they collaborate?</p>
        <p>
          A round-robin of great science fiction and fantasy stories: five
          authors each collaborating with each of the others and writing solo.
          Epic duels both human and divine, alien spaceships, a train full of
          sacrifices barreling straight toward a godâ€™s seat of power, and much,
          much more.

        This one was a lot of fun, and includes my favorite story to date,{" "}
        <i>Sudden Oak Death</i>. You really ought to check it out.
