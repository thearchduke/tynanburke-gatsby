    <h1>Greetings.</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my corner of the Web. My name is Tynan Burke, and I'm a web developer, digital librarian, and writer.</p>

    <p>According to the logs, most people come here for my <Link to="/work/">resum√© and portfolio</Link>.</p>

    <p>If you are not one of these people, or if you are but would like to see other things as well, 
I also write and draw <Link to="/words/#againststupidity">a webcomic</Link>, 
host <Link to="/work/#pathfork">a free writing-tools website</Link>, 
(very) occasionally <a href="https://tynan.blog">blog</a>,
and have <Link to="/photos/">a small sampling</Link> of film photography.</p>
